						"• Champion fighters focus on a style of combat exemplified by their deity. A shield-using champion benefits from the best of both worlds in shield feats.",
						"• Monk fighters are great at combining unusual weapon styles. For instance, a monks isn’t hindered by a restriction to keep one hand free, because they want to punch you with that hand anyway.",
						"• Ranger fighters can either specialize in archery or use their fighter feats to pick up an unusual combat style combination.",
						"• Rogue fighters can make good use of fighter’s free hand, two-weapon fighting, or archery feats.",
						"• Spellcaster fighters benefit greatly from the additional weapon proficiencies, and fighter is a solid choice for any spellcaster of a particularly martial bent."

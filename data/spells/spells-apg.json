Blessed One Through luck or deed, heritage or heroics, you carry the blessing of a deity. This blessing manifests as the ability to heal wounds and remove harmful conditions, and exists independent of worship. You might offer thanks daily to the deity whose power you wield, or you might carry these blessings reluctantly, seeking to avoid responsibility or even acting to defy the deity’s influence on you. You might wear the robes of the deity’s order, or you might give little thought and even less reverence to the source of your powers. However you feel about these gifts, there can be no doubt that you wield a special power. Good-aligned deities are most likely to empower a blessed one. However, deities of any alignment can grant such a blessing, as long as they are capable of granting a positive divine font to their clerics. This means such deities as Lamashtu might grant a foul version of the blessed one’s powers. Additional Feats: 6th Accelerating Touch (page 119), Mercy (Core Rulebook 111); 8th Invigorating Mercy (page 119); 10th Greater Mercy (Core Rulebook 112); 12th Elucidating Mercy (page 120), Resilient Touch (page 120); 14th Affliction Mercy (Core Rulebook 113), Amplifying Touch (page 120); 20th Rejuvenating Touch (page 121) BLESSED ONE DEDICATION FEAT 2 ARCHETYPE DEDICATION You are touched by a deity and gifted with the ability to alleviate the suffering of others. You gain the lay on hands devotion spell. It costs 1 Focus Point to cast a focus spell. This feat grants a focus pool of 1 Focus Point that you can recover using the Refocus activity (Core Rulebook 300). You can Refocus by meditating, whether you reflect on the deity granting the blessing or not, allowing your blessing to refill your focus pool. Your devotion spells from the blessed one archetype are divine spells. Special You can’t select another dedication feat until you have gained two other feats from the blessed one archetype. BLESSED SACRIFICE FEAT 4 ARCHETYPE Prerequisites Blessed One Dedication You gain the protector’s sacrifice domain spell as a devotion spell. Increase the number of Focus Points in your focus pool by 1. BLESSED SPELL {@as 1} FEAT 8 ARCHETYPE CONCENTRATE METAMAGIC Prerequisites Blessed One Dedication, ability to cast spells from spell slots, Mercy Frequency once per 10 minutes When you focus your magic on an ally, you can remove harmful conditions. If your next action is to Cast a Spell from a spell slot, and that spell targets only a single ally, you can also attempt to remove a harmful condition from that ally. The condition must be one that could be removed by your Mercy feat, including those granted by later feats such as Greater Mercy. Attempt a counteract check based on the spell’s DC and level. This effect is in addition to the normal effects of your spell. BLESSED DENIAL {@as R} FEAT 12 ARCHETYPE Prerequisites Blessed One Dedication Trigger An ally within 30 feet would become {@condition frightened}, {@condition drained}, {@condition enfeebled}, {@condition sickened}, or {@condition stupefied}. You exude peace and protection, lessening a harmful condition as it falls upon an ally. Reduce the value of the condition your ally would take by 1 (to a minimum of 0). If the ally takes more than one condition at the same time, choose one to reduce. Bounty Hunter Whether for coin, glory, or justice, you know how to track, defeat, and capture dangerous individuals. You’re accustomed to perusing wanted posters, searching up on leads, and pursuing villains to hell and back. Additional Feats: 14th Double Prey (Core Rulebook 175) BOUNTY HUNTER DEDICATION FEAT 2 ARCHETYPE DEDICATION Prerequisites trained in Survival When focused on finding your quarry, you’re relentless. You gain the Hunt Prey action (Core Rulebook 168). You can use Hunt Prey to designate only a creature that you’ve seen, heard about, or learned about through some other means, such as a bounty board or wanted poster. In addition to the other benefits of Hunt Prey, you gain a +2 circumstance bonus to checks to Gather Information regarding your prey. If you already have Hunt Prey, you become an expert in Survival and gain the circumstance bonus to Gather Information about your prey; you can still designate a creature you’re tracking during exploration, in addition to the conditions above. Special You can’t select another dedication feat until you have gained two other feats from the bounty hunter archetype. TOOLS OF THE TRADE FEAT 4 ARCHETYPE You’re well-versed in weapons that allow you to bring bounties in alive. You are trained with the following weapons: bola (page 248), sap, and whip. You gain access to bolas. Whenever you gain a class feature that grants you expert or greater proficiency in a given weapon or weapons, you also gain that proficiency in the weapons listed. In addition, you take no penalty when making a nonlethal attack with a weapon without the nonlethal trait. POSSE FEAT 4 ARCHETYPE EXPLORATION Requirements You have designated prey with Hunt Prey. By spending 1 minute giving guidance to help hunt down your prey, you instruct up to five willing creatures to assist you. They gain a +1 circumstance bonus to Seek your prey, to Track your prey, and to Gather Information about your prey. You and the creatures assisting you gain a +1 circumstance bonus to initiative rolls when entering combat with your prey. This benefit lasts until you designate a new prey or your prey dies, whichever comes first. An individual creature assisting you loses this benefit if they’re out of your presence for too long to benefit from your instructions. This is usually 1 hour, but is determined by the GM. KEEP PACE {@as R} FEAT 6 ARCHETYPE Trigger Your prey is within reach and attempts to move away from you. Your prey can’t Escape. Stride up to your Speed, following the foe and keeping it in reach throughout its movement until it stops moving or you’ve moved your full Speed. You can use Keep Pace to Burrow, Climb, Fly, or Swim instead of Stride if you have the corresponding movement type. OPPORTUNISTIC GRAPPLE {@as R} FEAT 8 ARCHETYPE Requirements Your prey is within your reach, you have at least one free hand, and your target is no more than one size larger than you. Trigger Your prey critically fails on a melee Strike’s attack roll against you. You attempt an Athletics check to Grapple your prey. Dedication feat becomes a mature animal companion, granting it additional capabilities. During an encounter, even if you don’t use the Command an Animal action, your animal companion can still use 1 action on your turn to Stride or Strike. QUICK MOUNT {@as 1} FEAT 4 ARCHETYPE SKILL Prerequisites Cavalier Dedication, expert in Nature Requirements You are adjacent to a creature that is at least one size larger than you and is willing to be your mount. You and your mount can spring into action at a moment’s notice. You Mount the creature and Command an Animal to issue it an order of your choice. DEFEND MOUNT {@as R} FEAT 6 ARCHETYPE Prerequisites Cavalier Dedication Trigger An enemy makes an attack roll against your mount while you’re riding it. You interpose yourself between an attacker and your mount, defending your mount from harm. Use your own AC against the triggering attack instead your mount’s AC. If the triggering attack hits, you take the effects of the attack instead of your mount. MOUNTED SHIELD FEAT 6 ARCHETYPE Prerequisites Cavalier Dedication You’ve trained with your shield to defend both yourself and your mount. When you Raise a Shield while mounted, both you and your mount gain the shield’s circumstance bonus to AC. If you have the Shield Block reaction, you can use it in response to your mount taking damage, as long as you’re CAVALIER PLEDGES Many cavaliers pledge themselves in service to a specific organization or individual, such as a noble family or sovereign ruler, a knightly order or another organization, or a particular ideal. A cavalier pledged to an order or ideal must uphold its edicts and is beholden to any anathema it has; for example, a cavalier pledged to the druid’s animal order would be tied to that anathema, while a cavalier pledged to the church of Abadar would be held to the same standards as a cleric of that god. If you pledge yourself to an entity or cause without a stated anathema, you should work with your GM to determine the edicts and anathema associated with your pledge. Cavaliers who have pledged themselves can gain access to certain abilities related to that pledge, such as Cavalier’s Banner. If you violate the anathema of your pledge, you lose access to those feats until you benefit from an atone ritual. Changing the subject of your pledge is equivalent to retraining a class feature."

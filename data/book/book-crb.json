Alternatively, it could include negotiating with a baron for rights to a fort, infiltrating an army of lumbering frost giants, or bargaining with an angel for a strand of hair required for an elixir to revive a slain friend.

Finally, {@b Charisma} indicates charm, persuasiveness, and force of personality.

						"In a Pathfinder game, three modes of play determine the pacing of each scene in the story. Most of your character’s time is spent in {@b exploration} , uncovering mysteries, solving problems, and interacting with other characters. The Age of Lost Omens abounds with danger, however, and characters often find themselves in an {@b encounter} , fighting savage beasts and terrifying monsters. Finally, time moves quickly when the characters enjoy {@b downtime} , a respite from the world’s troubles and a chance to rest and train for future expeditions. Throughout an adventure, game play moves between these three modes many times, as needed for the story. The more you play the game, the more you’ll see that each mode has its own play style, but moving from mode to mode has few hard boundaries.",
						"During the game, your character will face situations where the outcome is uncertain. A character might need to climb a sheer cliff, track down a wounded chimera, or sneak past a sleeping dragon, all of which are dangerous tasks with a price for failure. In such cases, the acting character (or characters) will be asked to attempt a to determine whether or not they succeed. A check is usually made by rolling a single 20-sided die (a d20) and adding a number based on the relevant ability. In such cases, rolling high is always good.",
						"Once a check is rolled, the GM compares the result to a target number called the {@b difficulty class (DC)} to determine the outcome. If the result of the check is equal to or greater than the DC, the check is successful. If it is less, the check is a failure. Beating the DC by 10 or more is referred to as a {@b critical success} , which usually grants an especially positive outcome. Similarly, failing the check by 10 or more is a {@b critical failure} (sometimes called a fumble). This sometimes results in additional negative effects. You also often score a critical success by rolling a 20 on the die when attempting a check (before adding anything). Likewise, rolling a 1 on the die when attempting a check often results in a critical failure. Note that not all checks have a special effect on a critical success or critical failure and such results should be treated just like an ordinary success or failure instead.",
						"For example, in pursuit of the {@condition wounded} chimera, your character might find the path blocked by a fast-moving river. You decide to swim across, but the GM declares this a dangerous task and asks you to roll an Athletics skill check (since swimming is covered by the Athletics skill). On your character sheet, you see that your character has a +8 modifier for such checks. Rolling the d20, you get an 18, for a total of 26. The GM compares this to the DC (which was 16) and finds that you got a critical success (since the result exceeded the DC by 10). Your character swims quickly across the river and continues the pursuit, drenched but unharmed. Had you gotten a result less than 26 but equal to or greater than 16, your character would have made it halfway across the river. Had your result been less than 16, your character might have been swept downriver or, worse, been pulled under the current and begun to drown!",
						"Checks like this are the heart of the game and are rolled all the time, in every mode of play, to determine the outcome of tasks. While the roll of the die is critical, the statistic you add to the roll (called a {@b modifier} ) often makes the difference between success and failure. Every character is made up of many such statistics governing what the character is good at, each consisting of a relevant ability modifier plus a {@b proficiency} bonus, and sometimes modified further by other factors, such as bonuses or penalties from gear, spells, feats, magic items, and other special circumstances.",
						"Proficiency is a simple way of assessing your character’s general level of training and aptitude for a given task. It is broken into five different ranks: {@b untrained} , {@b trained} , {@b expert} , {@b master} , and {@b legendary} . Each rank grants a different proficiency bonus. If you’re untrained at a statistic, your proficiency bonus is +0—you must rely solely on the raw potential of your ability modifier. If your proficiency rank for a statistic is trained, expert, master, and legendary, your bonus equals your character’s level plus another number based on the rank (2, 4, 6, and 8, respectively). Proficiency ranks are part of almost every statistic in the game.",

								"While exploration is handled in a free-form manner, encounters are more structured. The players and GM roll {@b initiative} to determine who acts in what order.

A saving throw is a check attempted against the DC of the spell or special ability targeting your character. There are three types of saving throws, and a character’s proficiency in each says a great deal about what they can endure. A {@b Fortitude} saving throw is used when your character’s health or vitality is under attack, such as from poison or disease.",
								"A {@b Reflex} saving throw is called for when your character must dodge away from danger, usually something that {@i affects a large area, such as the scorching blast of a fireball} spell. Finally, a {@b Will} saving throw is often your defense against spells and effects that target your character’s mind, {@i such as a charm or confusion spell. For all saving throws,} a success lessens the harmful effect, and scoring a critical success usually means your character escapes unscathed.",
								"Attacks, spells, hazards, and special abilities frequently either deal {@b damage} to a character or impose one or more {@b conditions} —and sometimes both. Damage is subtracted and when a creature is reduced to 0 HP, it falls unconscious and may die! A combat encounter typically lasts until one side has been defeated, and while this can mean retreat or surrender, it most often happens because one side is dead or dying. Conditions can hinder a creature for a time, limiting the actions they can use and applying penalties to future checks. Some conditions are even permanent, requiring a character to seek out powerful magic to undo their effects."

Lyz is playing Valeros, a daring human fighter, James is playing Merisiel, a deadly elven rogue, and Judy is taking on the role of Kyra, a fiery human cleric of Sarenrae. The group has just defeated a horde of undead and is making its way into an ancient mausoleum.",
						"{@b Erik:} The entrance to the crypt stands before you, a set of crumbling stairs leading down into darkness. A terrible smell issues forth from the doorway—the stench of old, rotted flesh.",
						"{@b Lyz:} I’m not afraid of a foul stink! I draw my sword and ready my shield.",
						"{@b Judy:} The light of Sarenrae will guide us. I cast my {@i light spell on my religious symbol.}",
						"{@b Erik:} All right, a glowing radiance spills forth, illuminating the stairs. They appear to go down only about 10 feet before opening up into a chamber. Puddles of stagnant water fill the cracks between uneven stone tiles.",
						"{@b James:} I should go first to make sure it’s safe. I’m going to draw my rapier and carefully go down the stairs, looking for traps as I go.",
						"{@b Erik:} Sure, but looking for traps is a secret check, so I’ll roll for you. What’s your Perception modifier?",
						"{@b James:} I have a +5.",
						"{@i Erik rolls a d20 behind his GM screen, {@condition hidden} from the players’ view, and gets a 17 on the die for a total of 22, more than enough to find the trip wire on the third step.}",
						"{@b Erik:} Your caution pays off! You spot a thin wire located at ankle height just above the third stair.",
						"{@b James:} I point it out to the others and head down.",
						"{@b Lyz:} I follow right behind Merisiel, avoiding the wire but otherwise keeping an eye out for danger.",
						"{@b Judy:} Me too.",
						"{@b Erik:} Okay! You make it down the stairs to find yourselves in a crypt. Ancient wood coffins are arranged around the room, covered in cobwebs and dust. Directly ahead, on a raised dais, is a stone casket adorned with wicked-looking symbols. You can tell that it was once wrapped in iron chains, but now twisted links are scattered around the room, along with chunks of what must have been the casket’s lid. From the damage, it looks like it was shattered from within!",
						"{@b Judy:} Sarenrae protect us. I draw my blade and advance—I want a better look at those symbols.",
						"{@b Lyz:} I’ll keep pace with her. I don’t like the look of this.",
						"{@b James:} I think I’ll stay back here and hide behind one of the coffins.",
						"{@b Erik:} Merisiel takes cover while the two of you advance. As you draw near, the stench of rot grows stronger until it’s almost overpowering.",
						"Suddenly you see the source of the horrid odor.",
						"Rising up out of the casket is a nightmarish dead thing. It might have once been a human, but it’s hard to tell from its withered body. Its flesh is the color of a new bruise, pulled so tight across its bones that it has split in places.",
						"It’s hairless, with pointed ears, but worst of all, its mouth is lined with tiny, sharp teeth and its tongue is entirely too long.",
						"{@b Lyz:} So, not a friend?",
						"{@b Erik:} Most certainly not. It looks poised to leap at you and attack. Roll for initiative! Valeros and Kyra need to roll Perception, while Merisiel should roll Stealth.",
						"{@i Everyone rolls for their initiative. Lyz rolls a 2 for Valeros, getting a total of 8. Judy rolls better for Kyra, getting a total of 14. James uses Stealth for Initiative, because Merisiel was hiding at the start of the fight, and rolls a 17 for a total of 25! Erik rolls for the undead creature, getting a 12. Erik records all these totals, putting the characters in order from highest to lowest.}",
						"{@b Erik:} Looks like Merisiel gets to act first. Whatever that thing is, you’re pretty sure it doesn’t know you are there.",
						"{@b James:} Awesome! For my first action, I want to draw a dagger. For my second, I want to move closer.",
						"{@b Erik:} You can get to within 15 feet of it with one Stride action.",
						"{@b James:} Perfect. For my final action, I’m going to throw my dagger at it!",
						"{@i James rolls a 13 and adds 8, due to Merisiel’s skill at thrown daggers, for a total of 21, but the range means he takes a –2 penalty for a result of 19. Erik consults his notes to learn that the monster has an AC of 18.}",
						"{@b Erik:} That’s a hit! Go ahead and roll damage.",
						"{@b James:} Okay, and I get to add extra damage due to sneak attack.",
						"{@i Rogues have the ability to deal extra damage to foes that haven’t acted yet in an encounter. This extra damage also applies to attacks against enemies that are distracted. James rolls 1d4 for the dagger and 1d6 for the sneak attack, and he adds 4 for Merisiel’s Dexterity, getting a total of 9.}",
						"{@b Erik:} It hisses as the blade sinks into its shoulder. That looks like it hurt, but the undead thing doesn’t appear to be slowing down. James, that was all three of your actions. Next up is Kyra!",
						"{@b Judy:} I think this is undead. What do I know about it?",
						"{@b Erik:} You use an action to recall your training about the living dead. Give me a Religion skill check.",
						"{@i Judy rolls a 16, adding Kyra’s +8 with Religion to get a total of 24.}",
						"{@b Erik:} At first, you thought this thing might be a ghoul, which is a type of undead that feasts on the flesh of the dead, but the terrible smell reveals the truth. This thing is a ghast, a more powerful type of ghoul. You are pretty sure that its stench can make you sick and that its claws can paralyze you with a touch.",
						"{@b Judy:} This is bad. I am going to spend my last two {@i actions to cast bless. It gives anyone next to me} a +1 bonus to attack rolls.",
						"{@i Casting this spell is an activity that requires two actions to complete, and it has two components. The complex gestures needed to invoke the spell are the somatic component, and Kyra’s prayers to her deity are the verbal component.}",
						"{@b Erik:} Okay! The ghast leaps from the casket straight toward Merisiel. The stench of its rotting body is absolutely horrific up close. Attempt a Fortitude save!",
						"{@i James rolls an 8, for a total of 14.}",
						"{@b Erik:} Not quite enough—you gain the {@condition sickened} 1 condition, which is going to give you a –1 penalty to most of your d20 rolls. Next, it lunges at you, trying to bite you!",
						"{@b James:} Oh no! I use my reaction to nimbly dodge out of the way.",
						"{@i Erik rolls an attack roll for the ghast, getting an 9 on the die. Looking at the monster’s statistics, he adds 11 for a total of 20. Merisiel’s AC is normally 19, but the Nimble Dodge feat lets her use her reaction to increase her AC by 2 against a single attack. In this case, it turns the ghast’s attack into a miss.}",
						"{@b Erik:} Does a 20 hit you?",
						"{@b James:} Nope, just missed!",
						"{@b Erik:} You twist away from the ghast as its tongue leaves a slimy film on your armor. With its final action, the undead menace lashes out at you with its claw.",
						"{@i Erik rolls a second attack with the ghast, this time with its claw. Normally this attack would take a –5 multiple attack penalty, but since the claw has the agile trait, the penalty is only –4. He rolls a 19 on the die, adds 11 for the ghoul’s attack modifier and subtracts 4, for a total of 26.}",
						"{@b Erik:} You may have dodged the ghast’s bite, but the thing’s bony claw rakes across your face!",
						"{@i Erik knows this is a hit and rolls the ghast’s claw damage,} {@b Erik:} Take 8 points of damage, and I need you to attempt a Fortitude saving throw as a numbing sensation spreads from the wound.",
						"{@i James rolls a Fortitude saving throw. He gets a 4 on the die, and after adding his bonus and the penalty from the sickened condition, it comes out to only a 9.}",
						"{@b James:} This isn’t my day. I don’t suppose a 9 is good enough?",
						"{@b Erik:} I am afraid not. You are {@condition paralyzed}!",
						"{@i Erik notes that Merisiel is {@condition paralyzed}, making her unable to act, but she will get a new saving throw at the end of each of her turns to shake off the effect.}",
						"{@b Erik:} A dry, creaking laugh escapes the ghast’s curled lips, but that’s the end of its turn. Valeros, you are the last one to act this round.",
						"{@b Lyz:} About time, too! I raise my shield and use my final two actions to make a Sudden Charge!",
						"{@i Sudden Charge is a fighter feat that lets Valeros move up to twice his Speed and attack at the end of his movement, all for only two actions.}",
						"{@b Erik:} As you draw near, the smell is horrific. Attempt a Fortitude save.",
						"{@i After rolling, Lyz gets a 19 on the Fortitude save.}",
						"{@b Erik:} You fight off the nausea from this thing’s stench. Make your attack roll.",
						"{@i Lyz rolls the die and it comes up a 20.}",
						"{@b Lyz:} I got a 20! That must be a critical success!",
						"{@b Erik:} Your blade hits the vile creature right in the neck, dealing double damage!",
						"{@i Lyz rolls a 5 on her d8, then adds 4 because of Valeros’s Strength modifier. Because it is a critical success, she then doubles the total.}",
						"{@b Lyz:} A mighty 18 damage! That surely had to kill it!",
						"{@b Erik:} I’m afraid not. Black ichor runs from the deep wound on its neck, but it only turns to look at you. You can see burning hatred in its eyes!",
						"{@b Lyz:} Uh-oh.",
						"{@i That is the end of the first round of combat. The second round begins immediately after this, using the same initiative order as before. The fight is far from over…}"

If your press action succeeds, you can choose to apply the failure effect instead. (For example, you may wish to do this when an attack deals no damage due to resistance.) Because a press action requires a multiple attack penalty, you can’t use one when it’s not your turn, even if you use the Ready activity.",

A stance lasts until you get knocked out, until its requirements (if any) are violated, until the encounter ends, or until you enter a new stance, whichever comes first. After you take an action with the stance trait, you can’t take another one for 1 round. You can enter or be in a stance only in encounter mode."

										"{@b Agile:} The multiple attack penalty you take with this weapon on the second attack on your turn is –4 instead of –5, and –8 instead of –10 on the third and subsequent attacks in the turn.",
										"{@b Attached:} An attached weapon must be combined with another piece of gear to be used. The trait lists what type of item the weapon must be attached to. You must be wielding or wearing the item the weapon is attached to in order to attack with it. For example, shield spikes are attached to a shield, allowing you to attack with the spikes instead of a shield bash, but only if you’re wielding the shield. An attached weapon is usually bolted onto or built into the item it’s attached to, and typically an item can have only one weapon attached to it. An attached weapon can be affixed to an item with 10 minutes of work and a successful DC 10 Crafting check; this includes the time needed to remove the weapon from a previous item, if necessary. If an item is destroyed, its attached weapon can usually be salvaged.",
										"{@b Backstabber:} When you hit a {@condition flat-footed} creature, this weapon deals 1 precision damage in addition to its normal damage. The precision damage increases to 2 if {@i the weapon is a +3 weapon.}",
										"{@b Backswing:} You can use the momentum from a missed attack with this weapon to lead into your next attack.",
										"After missing with this weapon on your turn, you gain a +1 circumstance bonus to your next attack with this weapon before the end of your turn.",
										"{@b Deadly:} On a critical hit, the weapon adds a weapon damage die of the listed size. Roll this after doubling the weapon’s damage. This increases to two dice if the weapon {@i has a greater striking rune and three dice if the weapon has a major striking rune. For instance, a rapier with a greater striking rune deals 2d8 extra piercing damage on a critical} hit. An ability that changes the size of the weapon’s normal damage dice doesn’t change the size of its deadly die.",
										"{@b Disarm:} You can use this weapon to Disarm with the Athletics skill even if you don’t have a free hand. This uses the weapon’s reach (if different from your own) and adds the weapon’s item bonus to attack rolls (if any) as an item bonus to the Athletics check. If you critically fail a check to Disarm using the weapon, you can drop the weapon to take the effects of a failure instead of a critical failure. On a critical success, you still need a free hand if you want to take the item.",

										"{@b Finesse:} You can use your Dexterity modifier instead of your Strength modifier on attack rolls using this melee weapon. You still use your Strength modifier when calculating damage.",
										"{@b Forceful:} This weapon becomes more dangerous as you build momentum. When you attack with it more than once on your turn, the second attack gains a circumstance bonus to damage equal to the number of weapon damage dice, and each subsequent attack gains a circumstance bonus to damage equal to double the number of weapon damage dice.",
										"{@b Free-Hand:} This weapon doesn’t take up your hand, usually because it is built into your armor. A free-hand weapon can’t be Disarmed. You can use the hand covered by your free-hand weapon to wield other items, perform manipulate actions, and so on. You can’t attack with a free-hand weapon if you’re wielding anything in that hand or otherwise using that hand. When you’re not wielding anything and not otherwise using the hand, you can use abilities that require you to have a hand free as well as those that require you to be wielding a weapon in that hand.

This uses the weapon’s reach (if different from your own) and adds the weapon’s item bonus to attack rolls as an item bonus to the Athletics check. If you critically fail a check to Grapple using the weapon, you can drop the weapon to take the effects of a failure instead of a critical failure.",
										"{@b Halfling:} Halflings craft and use these weapons.",
										"{@b Jousting:} The weapon is suited for mounted combat with a harness or similar means. When mounted, if you moved at least 10 feet on the action before your attack, add a circumstance bonus to damage for that attack equal to the number of damage dice for the weapon. In addition, while mounted, you can wield the weapon in one hand, changing the damage die to the listed value.",
										"{@b Monk:} Many monks learn to use these weapons.",
										"{@b Nonlethal:} Attacks with this weapon are nonlethal (page 453), and are used to knock creatures unconscious instead of kill them. You can use a nonlethal weapon to make a lethal attack with a –2 circumstance penalty.",
										"{@b Orc:} Orcs craft and use these weapons.",
										"{@b Parry:} This weapon can be used defensively to block attacks. While wielding this weapon, if your proficiency with it is trained or better, you can spend an Interact action to position your weapon defensively, gaining a +1 circumstance bonus to AC until the start of your next turn.",
										"{@b Propulsive:} You add half your Strength modifier (if positive) to damage rolls with a propulsive ranged weapon. If you have a negative Strength modifier, you add your full Strength modifier instead.",
										"{@b Reach:} This weapon is long and can be used to attack creatures up to 10 feet away instead of only adjacent creatures. For creatures that already have reach with the limb or limbs that wield the weapon, the weapon increases their reach by 5 feet.",
										"{@b Shove:} You can use this weapon to Shove with the Athletics skill even if you don’t have a free hand. This uses the weapon’s reach (if different from your own) and adds the weapon’s item bonus to attack rolls as an item bonus to the Athletics check. If you critically fail a check to Shove using the weapon, you can drop the weapon to take the effects of a failure instead of a critical failure.",
										"{@b Sweep:} This weapon makes wide sweeping or spinning attacks, making it easier to attack multiple enemies. When you attack with this weapon, you gain a +1 circumstance bonus to your attack roll if you already attempted to attack a different target this turn using this weapon.",
										"{@b Thrown:} You can throw this weapon as a ranged attack. A thrown weapon adds your Strength modifier to damage just like a melee weapon does. When this trait appears on a melee weapon, it also includes the range increment. Ranged weapons with this trait use the range increment specified in the weapon’s Range entry.",
										"{@b Trip:} You can use this weapon to Trip with the Athletics skill even if you don’t have a free hand. This uses the weapon’s reach (if different from your own) and adds the weapon’s item bonus to attack rolls as an item bonus to the Athletics check. If you critically fail a check to Trip using the weapon, you can drop the weapon to take the effects of a failure instead of a critical failure.",
										"{@b Twin:} These weapons are used as a pair, complementing each other. When you attack with a twin weapon, you add a circumstance bonus to the damage roll equal to the weapon’s number of damage dice if you have previously attacked with a different weapon of the same type this turn. The weapons must be of the same type to benefit from this trait, but they don’t need to have the same runes.",
										"{@b Two-Hand:} This weapon can be wielded with two hands. Doing so changes its weapon damage die to the indicated value. This change applies to all the weapon’s {@i damage dice, such as those from striking runes.}",
										"{@b Unarmed:} An unarmed attack uses your body rather than a manufactured weapon. An unarmed attack isn’t a weapon, though it’s categorized with weapons for weapon groups, and it might have weapon traits. Since it’s part of your body, an unarmed attack can’t be Disarmed. It also doesn’t take up a hand, though a fist or other grasping appendage follows the same rules as a free-hand weapon.",
										"{@b Versatile:} A versatile weapon can be used to deal a different type of damage than that listed in the Damage entry. This trait indicates the alternate damage type. For instance, a piercing weapon that is versatile S can be used to deal piercing or slashing damage. You choose the damage type each time you make an attack.",
										"{@b Volley:} This ranged weapon is less effective at close distances. Your attacks against targets that are at a distance within the range listed take a –2 penalty."

								"Certain feats, class features, weapon runes, and other effects can grant you additional benefits when you make an attack with certain weapons and get a critical success.",
								"This is called a critical specialization effect. The exact effect depends on which weapon group your weapon belongs to, as listed below. You can always decide not to add the critical specialization effect of your weapon.",
								"{@b Axe:} Choose one creature adjacent to the initial target and within reach. If its AC is lower than your attack roll result for the critical hit, you deal damage to that creature equal to the result of the weapon damage die you rolled (including extra dice for its potency rune, if any). This amount isn’t doubled, and no bonuses or other additional dice apply to this damage.",
								"{@b Bomb:} Increase the radius of the bomb’s splash damage (if any) to 10 feet.",
								"{@b Bow:} If the target of the critical hit is adjacent to a surface, it gets stuck to that surface by the missile. The target is immobilized and must spend an Interact action to attempt a DC 10 Athletics check to pull the missile free; it can’t move from its space until it succeeds. The creature doesn’t become stuck if it is incorporeal, is liquid (like a water elemental or some oozes), or could otherwise escape without effort.",
								"{@b Brawling:} The target must succeed at a Fortitude save against your class DC or be slowed 1 until the end of your next turn.",
								"{@b Club:} You knock the target away from you up to 10 feet (you choose the distance). This is forced movement (page 475).",
								"{@b Dart:} The target takes {@dice 1d6} {@condition Persistent Damage|CRB|persistent bleed damage}.",
								"You gain an item bonus to this bleed damage equal to the weapon’s item bonus to attack rolls.",
								"{@b Flail:} The target is knocked {@condition prone}.",
								"{@b Hammer:} The target is knocked {@condition prone}.",
								"{@b Knife:} The target takes {@dice 1d6} {@condition Persistent Damage|CRB|persistent bleed} damage. You gain an item bonus to this bleed damage equal to the weapon’s item bonus to attack rolls.",
								"{@b Pick:} The weapon viciously pierces the target, who takes 2 additional damage per weapon damage die.",
								"{@b Polearm:} The target is moved 5 feet in a direction of your choice. This is forced movement (page 475).",
								"{@b Shield:} You knock the target back from you 5 feet.",
								"This is forced movement (page 475).",
								"{@b Sling:} The target must succeed at a Fortitude save against your class DC or be stunned 1.",

										"Each of the weapons listed in Tables 6–7 and 6–8 are described below.",
										"{@b Alchemical Bomb:} These bombs come in a variety of types and levels of power, but no matter the variety, you throw the bomb at the target and it explodes, unleashing its alchemical blast.",
										"{@b Arrow:} These projectiles are the ammunition for bows. The shaft of an arrow is made of wood. It is stabilized in flight by fletching at one end and bears a metal head on the other.",
										"{@b Bastard Sword:} This broad-bladed sword, sometimes called the hand‑and‑a‑half sword, has a longer grip so it can be held in one hand or used with two hands to provide extra piercing or slashing power.",
										"{@b Battle Axe:} These axes are designed explicitly as weapons, rather than tools. They typically weigh less, with a shaft reinforced with metal bands or bolts, and have a sharper blade, making them ideal for chopping limbs rather than wood.",
										"{@b Bolt:} Shorter than traditional arrows but similar in construction, bolts are the ammunition used by crossbows.",
										"{@b Blowgun:} This long, narrow tube is used for shooting blowgun darts, using only the power of a forcefully exhaled breath.",
										"{@b Blowgun Dart:} These thin, light darts are typically made of hardwood and stabilized with fletching of down or fur. They are often hollow so they can be used to deliver poison.",
										"{@b Bo Staff:} This strong but slender staff is tapered at the ends and well balanced. It’s designed to be an offensive and defensive weapon.",
										"{@b Clan Dagger:} This broad dagger is carried by dwarves as a weapon, tool, and designation of clan. Losing or having to surrender a clan dagger is considered a mark of embarrassment to most dwarves.",
										"{@b Club:} This is a piece of stout wood shaped or repurposed to bludgeon an enemy. Clubs can be intricately carved pieces of martial art or as simple as a tree branch or piece of wood.",
										"{@b Composite Longbow:} This projectile weapon is made from horn, wood, and sinew laminated together to increase the power of its pull and the force of its projectile. Like all longbows, its great size also increases the bow’s range and power. You must use two hands to fire it, and it cannot be used while mounted. Any time an ability is specifically restricted to a longbow, such as Erastil’s favored weapon, it also applies to composite longbows unless otherwise stated.",
										"{@b Composite Shortbow:} This shortbow is made from horn, wood, and sinew laminated together to increase the power of its pull and the force of its projectile. Its compact size and power make it a favorite of mounted archers. Any time an ability is specifically restricted to a shortbow, it also applies to composite shortbows unless otherwise stated.",
										"{@b Crossbow:} This ranged weapon has a bow-like assembly mounted on a handled frame called a tiller.",
										"The tiller has a mechanism to lock the bowstring in place, attached to a trigger mechanism that releases the tension and launches a bolt.",
										"{@b Dagger:} This small, bladed weapon is held in one hand and used to stab a creature in close combat. It can also be thrown.",
										"{@b Dart:} This thrown weapon is larger than an arrow but shorter than a javelin. It typically has a short shaft of wood ending in a metal tip and is sometimes stabilized by feathers or fur.",
										"{@b Dogslicer:} This short, curved, and crude makeshift blade often has holes drilled into it to reduce its weight.",
										"It’s a favored weapon of goblins.",
										"{@b Dwarven Waraxe:} This favored weapon of the dwarves has a large, ornate head mounted on a thick handle. This powerful axe can be wielded with one hand or two.",
										"{@b Elven Curve Blade:} Essentially a longer version of the scimitar, this traditional elven weapon has a thinner blade than its cousin.",
										"{@b Falchion:} This weapon is a heavier, two‑handed version of the curved-bladed scimitar. It is weighted toward the blade’s end, making it a powerful slashing weapon.",
										"{@b Filcher’s Fork:} This halfling weapon looks like a long, two-pronged fork and is used as both a weapon and a cooking implement.",
										"{@b Flail:} This weapon consists of a wooden handle attached to a spiked ball or cylinder by a chain, rope, or strap of leather.",
										"{@b Gauntlet:} A pair of these metal gloves comes with full plate, half plate, and splint armor; they can also be purchased separately and worn with other types of armor. They not only protect your hands but also transform your hands into lethal weapons.",
										"{@b Glaive:} This polearm consists of a long, single-edged blade on the end of a 7-foot pole. It is extremely effective at delivering lethal cuts at a distance.",
										"{@b Gnome Flickmace:} More a flail than a mace, this weapon has a short handle attached to a length of chain with a ball at the end. The ball is propelled to its reach with the flick of the wrist, the momentum of which brings the ball back to the wielder after the strike.",
										"{@b Gnome Hooked Hammer:} This gnome tool and weapon features a hammer at one end and a curved pick on the other. It’s such a strange and awkward weapon that others think the gnomes are slightly erratic for using it.",
										"{@b Greataxe:} This large battle axe is too heavy to wield with only one hand. Many greataxes incorporate two blades, and they are often “bearded,” having a hook at the bottom to increase the strength of their chopping power.",
										"{@b Greatclub:} While many greatclubs are intricately carved, others are little more than a sturdy tree branch. These massive clubs are too heavy to wield with only one hand.",
										"{@b Greatpick:} This pick has a longer handle and broader head than a regular pick. It is too heavy to wield in one hand.",
										"{@b Greatsword:} This immense two-handed sword is nearly as tall as its wielder. Its lower blade is often somewhat dulled to allow it to be gripped for extra leverage in close-quarter fights.",
										"{@b Guisarme:} This polearm bears a long, often one‑sided, curved blade with a hook protruding from the blunt side of the blade, which can allow its wielder to trip opponents at a distance. Its shaft is usually 8 feet long.",
										"{@b Halberd:} This polearm has a relatively short, 5-foot shaft. The business end is a long spike with an axe blade attached.",
										"{@b Halfling Sling Staff:} This staff ends in a Y-shaped split that cradles a sling. The length of the staff provides excellent leverage when used two‑handed to fling rocks or bullets from the sling.",
										"{@b Hand Crossbow:} Sometimes referred to as an alley bow by rogues or ruffians, this small crossbow fires small bolts that are sometimes used to deliver poison to the target. It’s small enough to be shot one-handed, but it still requires two hands to load.",
										"{@b Hatchet:} This small axe can be used in close combat or thrown.",
										"{@b Heavy Crossbow:} This large crossbow is harder to load and more substantial than a regular crossbow, but it packs a greater punch.",
										"{@b Horsechopper:} Created by goblins to battle horses, this weapon is essentially a long shaft ending in a blade with a large hook.",
										"{@b Javelin:} This thin spear is well balanced for throwing but is not designed for melee use.",
										"{@b Kama:} Similar to a sickle and used in some regions to reap grain, a kama has a short, slightly curved blade and a wooden handle.",
										"{@b Katana:} A katana is a curved, single-edged sword known for its wickedly sharped blade.",
										"{@b Katar:} Also known as punching daggers, katars are characterized by their H-shaped hand grip that allows the blade to jut out from the knuckles.",
										"{@b Kukri:} The blade of this foot-long knife curves inward and lacks a cross guard at the hilt.",
										"{@b Lance:} This spear-like weapon is used by a mounted creature to deal a great deal of damage.",
										"{@b Light Hammer:} This smaller version of the warhammer has a wooden or metal shaft ending in a metal head.",
										"Unlike its heavier cousin, it is light enough to throw.",
										"{@b Light Mace:} A light mace has a short wooden or metal shaft ending with a dense metal head. Used much like a club, it delivers heavy bludgeoning blows, but with extra power derived from the head’s metal ridges or spikes.",
										"{@b Light Pick:} A light pick is a modified mining implement with a wooden shaft ending in a pick head crafted more to pierce armor and flesh than chip rocks.",
										"{@b Longbow:} This 5-foot-tall bow, usually made of a single piece of elm, hickory, or yew, has a powerful draw and is excellent at propelling arrows with great force and at an extreme distance. You must use two hands to fire a longbow, and it can’t be used while mounted.",
										"{@b Longspear:} This very long spear, sometimes called a pike, is purely for thrusting rather than throwing. Used by many soldiers and city watch for crowd control and defense against charging enemies, it must be wielded with two hands.",
										"{@b Longsword:} Longswords can be one-edged or two‑edged swords. Their blades are heavy and they’re between 3 and 4 feet in length.",
										"{@b Shortbow:} This smaller bow is made of a single piece of wood and favored by skirmishers and cavalry.",
										"{@b Shortsword:} These blades come in a variety of shapes and styles, but they are typically 2 feet long.",
										"{@b Shuriken:} This “throwing star” is a small piece of flat metal with sharp edges, designed to be flung with a flick of the wrist.",
										"{@b Sickle:} Originally a farming tool used for reaping grain, this one-handed weapon has a short wooden handle ending in a curved blade, sometimes sharpened on both sides.",
										"{@b Sling:} Little more than a leather cup attached to a pair of straps, a sling can be used to fling smooth stones or sling bullets at a range.",
										"{@b Sling Bullet:} These are small metal balls, typically either iron or lead, designed to be used as ammunition in slings.",
										"{@b Spear:} A long metal shaft ending with a metal spike, a spear can be used one-handed as a melee weapon and can be thrown.",
										"{@b Spiked Chain:} This 4‑foot‑long length of chain is covered with barbs and has spikes on one or both ends.",
										"Some feature metal hoops used as handgrips.",
										"{@b Spiked Gauntlet:} Providing the same defensive function as a standard gauntlet, this version has a group of spikes protruding from the knuckles to deliver piercing damage with a punch.",
										"{@b Staff:} This long piece of wood can aid in walking and deliver a mighty blow.",
										"{@b Starknife:} From a central metal ring, four tapering metal blades extend like points on a compass rose. When gripping a starknife from the center, the wielder can use it as a melee weapon. It can also be thrown short distances.",
										"{@b Temple Sword:} This heavy blade is favored by guardians of religious sites. It has a distinctive, crescent-shaped blade that seems to be a mix of a sickle and sword. It often has holes drilled into the blade or the pommel so that bells or other holy trinkets can be affixed to the weapon as an aid for prayer or mediation.",
										"{@b Trident:} This three-pronged, spear-like weapon typically has a 4-foot shaft. Like a spear, it can be wielded with one hand or thrown.",
										"{@b War Flail:} This large flail has a long shaft connected to a shorter piece of stout wood or metal that’s sometimes inlaid with spikes.",
										"{@b Warhammer:} This weapon has a wooden shaft ending in a large, heavy metal head. The head of the hammer might be single-sided or double-sided, but it’s always capable of delivering powerful bludgeoning blows.",
										"{@b Whip:} This long strand of thick leather, often braided, delivers a painful but nonlethal slash at a distance, usually accompanied by a distinctive cracking sound.",
										"{@b Mace:} With a stout haft and a heavy metal head, a mace is sturdy and allows its wielder to deliver powerful blows and dent armor.",
										"{@b Main-Gauche:} This parrying dagger features a robust guard to protect the wielder’s hand.",
										"{@b Maul:} Mauls are massive warhammers that must be swung with two hands.",
										"{@b Morningstar:} This weapon has a short shaft ending in a metal ball studded with spikes.",
										"{@b Nunchaku:} The nunchaku is constructed of two wooden or metal bars connected by a short length of rope or chain.",
										"{@b Orc Knuckle Dagger:} This stout, metal blade of orc design has a horizontal basket hilt with blades jutting from each end, or sometimes one blade like that of a katar.",
										"{@b Orc Necksplitter:} This single-bladed bearded axe has a jagged blade that’s perfect for separating bone from tendon and cartilage.",
										"{@b Pick:} A pick designed solely for combat has a sturdy wooden shaft and a heavy, pointed head to deliver devastating blows.",
										"{@b Ranseur:} This polearm is a long trident with a central prong that’s longer than the other two.",
										"{@b Rapier:} The rapier is a long and thin piercing blade with a basket hilt. It is prized among many as a dueling weapon.",
										"{@b Sai:} This piercing dagger is a metal spike flanked by a pair of prongs that can be used to trap an enemy’s weapon.",
										"{@b Sap:} A sap has a soft wrapping around a dense core, typically a leather sheath around a lead rod. Its head is wider than its grip to disperse the force of a blow, as the weapon’s purpose is to knock out its victim rather than to draw blood.",
										"{@b Sawtooth Saber:} The signature weapon of the Red Mantis assassins, this curved blade is serrated like a saw, hence the name.",
										"{@b Scimitar:} This one-handed curved blade is sharp on one side.",
										"{@b Scythe:} Derived from a farming tool used to mow down long grains and cereals, this weapon has a long wooden shaft with protruding handles, capped with a curved blade set at a right angle.",
										"{@b Shield Bash:} A shield bash is not actually a weapon, but a maneuver in which you thrust or swing your shield to hit your foe with an impromptu attack.",
										"{@b Shield Boss:} Typically a round, convex, or conical piece of thick metal attached to the center of a shield, a shield boss increases the bludgeoning damage of a shield bash.",
										"{@b Shield Spikes:} These metal spikes are strategically placed on the defensive side of the shield to deal piercing damage with a shield bash."

								"These items follow special rules or require more detail.",
								"{@b Adventurer’s Pack:} This item is the starter kit for an adventurer, containing the essential items for exploration and survival. The Bulk value is for the entire pack together, but see the descriptions of individual items as necessary.",
								"The pack contains the following items: backpack (containing the other goods), bedroll, two belt pouches, 10 pieces of chalk, flint and steel, 50 feet of rope, 2 weeks’ rations, soap, 5 torches, and a waterskin.",
								"{@b Alchemist’s Tools:} These beakers and chemicals can be used to set up a mobile alchemical laboratory. Expanded alchemist’s tools give a +1 item bonus to Crafting checks to create alchemical items. When you carry the tools from place to place, you keep many of the components handy on your person, in pockets or bandoliers.",
								"{@b Artisan’s Tools:} You need these tools to create items from raw materials with the Craft skill. Sterling artisan’s tools give you a +1 item bonus to the check. Different sets are needed for different work, as determined by the GM; for example, blacksmith’s tools differ from woodworker’s tools.",
								"{@b Backpack:} A backpack holds up to 4 Bulk of items. If you’re carrying or stowing the pack rather than wearing it on your back, its bulk is light instead of negligible.",
								"{@b Bandolier:} A bandolier holds up to eight items of light Bulk within easy reach and is usually used for alchemical items or potions. If you are carrying or stowing a bandolier rather than wearing it around your chest, it has light Bulk instead of negligible. A bandolier can be dedicated to a full set of tools, such as healer’s tools, allowing you to draw the tools as part of the action that requires them.",
								"{@b Basic Crafter’s Book:} This book contains the formulas (page 293) for Crafting the common items in this chapter.",
								"{@b Belt Pouch:} A belt pouch holds up to four items of light Bulk.",
								"{@b Caltrops:} These four-pronged metal spikes can cause damage to a creature’s feet. You can scatter caltrops in an empty square adjacent to you with an Interact action. The first creature that moves into that square must succeed at a DC 14 Acrobatics check or take 1d4 piercing damage and 1 persistent bleed damage. A creature taking persistent bleed damage from caltrops takes a –5-foot penalty to its Speed. Spending an Interact action to pluck the caltrops free reduces the DC to stop the bleeding. Once a creature takes damage from caltrops, enough caltrops are ruined that other creatures moving into the square are safe.",
								"Deployed caltrops can be salvaged and reused if no creatures took damage from them. Otherwise, enough caltrops are ruined that they can’t be salvaged.",
								"{@b Candle:} A lit candle sheds dim light in a 10-foot radius.",
								"{@b Chest:} A wooden chest can hold up to 8 Bulk of items.",
								"{@b Climbing Kit:} This satchel includes 50 feet of rope, pulleys, a dozen pitons, a hammer, a grappling hook, and one set of crampons. Climbing kits allow you to attach yourself to the wall you’re Climbing, moving half as quickly as usual (minimum 5 feet) but letting you attempt a DC 5 flat check whenever you critically fail to prevent a fall. You gain a +1 item bonus to Athletics checks to Climb while using an extreme climbing kit. A single kit has only enough materials for one climber; each climber needs their own kit.",
								"{@b Clothing:} Ordinary clothing is functional with basic tailoring, such as peasant garb, monk’s robes, or work clothes.",
								"Explorer’s clothing is sturdy enough that it can be reinforced to protect you, even though it isn’t a suit of armor. It comes in many forms, though the most common sorts look like clerical vestments, monk’s garments, or wizard’s robes, as members of all three classes are likely to avoid wearing armor. For more information on explorer’s clothing, see pages 275–276.",
								"Fine clothing, suitable for a noble or royal, is made with expensive fabrics, precious metals, and intricate patterns.",
								"You gain a +1 item bonus to checks to Make an Impression on nobility or other upper-class folk while wearing highfashion fine clothing.",
								"Winter clothing allows you to negate the damage from severe environmental cold and reduce the damage from extreme cold to that of severe cold.",
								"{@b Compass:} A compass helps you Sense Direction or navigate, provided you’re in a location with uniform magnetic fields. Without a compass, you take a –2 item penalty to these checks (similar to using a shoddy item).",
								"A lensatic compass gives you a +1 item bonus to these checks.",
								"{@b Crowbar:} When Forcing Open an object that doesn’t have an easy grip, a crowbar makes it easier to gain the necessary leverage. Without a crowbar, prying something open takes a –2 item penalty to the Athletics check to Force Open (similar to using a shoddy item). A levered crowbar grants you a +1 item bonus to Athletics checks to Force Open anything that can be pried open.",
								"{@b Disguise Kit:} This small wooden box contains cosmetics, false facial hair, spirit gum, and a few simple wigs. You usually need a disguise kit to set up a disguise in order to Impersonate someone using the Deception skill.",
								"An elite disguise kit adds a +1 item bonus to relevant checks. If you’ve crafted a large number of disguises, you can replenish your cosmetics supply with replacement cosmetics suitable for the type of your disguise kit.",
								"{@b Fishing Tackle:} This kit include a collapsible fishing pole, fishhooks, line, lures, and a fishing net. Professional fishing tackle grants a +1 item bonus to checks to fish.",
								"{@b Flint and Steel:} Flint and steel are useful in creating a fire if you have the time to catch a spark, though using them is typically too time-consuming to be practical during an encounter. Even in ideal conditions, using flint and steel to light a flame requires using at least 3 actions, and often significantly longer.",
								"{@b Formula Book:} A formula book holds the formulas necessary to make items other than the common equipment from this chapter; alchemists typically get one for free. Each formula book can hold the formulas for up to 100 different items. Formulas can also appear on parchment sheets, tablets, and almost any other medium; there’s no need for you to copy them into a specific book as long as you can keep them on hand to reference them.",
								"{@b Grappling Hook:} You can throw a grappling hook with a rope tied to it to make a climb easier. To anchor a grappling hook, make an attack roll with the secret trait against a DC depending on the target, typically at least DC 20. On a success, your hook has a firm hold, but on a critical failure, the hook seems like it will hold but actually falls when you’re partway up.",
								"{@b Healer’s Tools:} This kit of bandages, herbs, and suturing tools is necessary for Medicine checks to Administer First Aid, Treat Disease, Treat Poison, or Treat Wounds.",
								"Expanded healer’s tools provide a +1 item bonus to such checks. When you carry the tools from place to place, you keep many of the components handy on your person, in pockets or bandoliers.",
								"{@b Holly and Mistletoe:} Plants of supernatural significance provide a primal focus for primal spellcasters, such as druids, when using certain abilities and casting some spells.",
								"A bundle of holly and mistletoe must be held in one hand to use it. Other primal foci exist for druids focused on other aspects of nature.",
								"{@b Lantern:} A lantern sheds bright light and requires 1 pint of oil to function for 6 hours.",
								"A bull’s-eye lantern emits its light in a 60‑foot cone (and dim light in the next 60 feet).",
								"A hooded lantern sheds light in a 30‑foot radius (and dim light in the next 30 feet) and is equipped with shutters, which you can close to block the light.",
								"Closing or opening the shutters takes an Interact action.",
								"{@b Lock:} Picking a poor lock requires two successful DC 15 Thievery checks, a simple lock requires three successful DC 20 Thievery checks, an average lock requires four successes at DC 25, a good lock requires five successes at DC 30, and a superior lock six successes at DC 40.",
								"{@b Magnifying Glass:} This quality handheld lens gives you a +1 item bonus to Perception checks to notice minute details of documents, fabric, and the like.",
								"{@b Manacles:} You can manacle someone who is willing or otherwise at your mercy as an exploration activity taking 10–30 seconds depending on the creature’s size and how many manacles you apply. A two-legged creature with its legs bound takes a –15-foot circumstance penalty to its Speeds, and a two-handed creature with its wrists bound has to succeed at a DC 5 flat check any time it uses a manipulate action or else that action fails. This DC may be higher depending on how tightly the manacles constrain the hands. A creature bound to a stationary object is immobilized. For creatures with more or fewer limbs, the GM determines what effect manacles have, if any. Freeing a creature from poor manacles requires two successful DC 17 Thievery checks, simple manacles requires three successes at DC 22, average manacles require four successes at DC 27, good manacles require five successes at DC 32, and superior manacles require six successes at DC 42.",
								"{@b Material Component Pouch:} This pouch contains material components for those spells that require them.",
								"Though the components are used up over time, you can refill spent components during your daily preparations.",
								"{@b Musical Instrument:} Handheld instruments include bagpipes, a small set of chimes, small drums, fiddles and viols, flutes and recorders, small harps, lutes, trumpets, and similarly sized instruments. The GM might rule that an especially large handheld instrument (like a tuba) has greater Bulk. Heavy instruments such as large drums, a full set of chimes, and keyboard instruments are less portable and generally need to be stationary while played.",
								"A virtuoso instrument gives a +1 item bonus to Performance checks using that instrument.",
								"{@b Oil:} You can use oil to fuel lanterns, but you can also set a pint of oil aflame and throw it. You must first spend an Interact action preparing the oil, then throw it with another action as a ranged attack. If you hit, it splatters on the creature or in a single 5-foot square you target. You must succeed at a DC 10 flat check for the oil to ignite successfully when it hits.",
								"If the oil ignites, the target takes {@dice 1d6} fire damage.",
								"{@b Piton:} These small spikes can be used as anchors to make climbing easier. To affix a piton, you must hold it in one hand and use a hammer to drive it in with your other hand. You can attach a rope to the hammered piton so that you don’t fall all the way to the ground on a critical failure while Climbing.",
								"{@b Religious Symbol:} This piece of wood or silver is emblazoned with an image representing a deity. Some divine spellcasters, such as clerics, can use a religious symbol of their deity as a divine focus to use certain abilities and cast some spells. A religious symbol must be held in one hand to use it.",
								"{@b Religious Text:} This manuscript contains scripture of a particular religion. Some divine spellcasters, such as clerics, can use a religious text as a divine focus to use certain abilities and cast some spells. A religious text must be held in one hand to use it.",
								"{@b Repair Kit:} A repair kit allows you to perform simple repairs while traveling.",
								"It contains a portable anvil, tongs, woodworking tools, a whetstone, and oils for conditioning leather and wood. You can use a repair kit to Repair items using the Crafting skill. A superb repair kit gives you a +1 item bonus to the check.",
								"{@b Sack:} A sack can hold up to 8 Bulk worth of items. A sack containing 2 Bulk or less can be worn on the body, usually tucked into a belt. You can carry a sack with one hand, but must use two hands to transfer items in and out.",
								"{@b Saddlebags:} Saddlebags come in a pair. Each can hold up to 3 Bulk of items. The Bulk value given is for saddlebags worn by a mount. If you are carrying or stowing saddlebags, they count as 1 Bulk instead of light Bulk.",
								"{@b Satchel:} A satchel can hold up to 2 Bulk worth of items. If you are carrying or stowing a satchel rather than wearing it over your shoulder, it counts as light Bulk instead of negligible.",
								"{@b Scholarly Journal:} Scholarly journals are uncommon.",
								"Each scholarly journal is a folio on a very specific topic, such as vampires or the history of a single town or neighborhood of a city. If you spend 1 minute referencing an academic journal before attempting a skill check to Recall Knowledge about the subject, you gain a +1 item bonus to the check. A compendium of journals costs five times as much as a single journal and requires both hands to use; each compendium contains several journals and grants its bonus on a broader topic, such as all undead or a whole city. The GM determines what scholarly journals are available in any location.",
								"{@b Scroll Case:} Scrolls, maps, and other rolled documents are stored in scroll cases for safe transport.",
								"{@b Sheath:} A sheath or scabbard lets you easily carry a weapon on your person.",
								"{@b Signal Whistle:} When sounded, a signal whistle can be heard clearly up to half a mile away across open terrain.",
								"{@b Snare Kit:} This kit contains tools and materials for creating snares. A snare kit allows you to Craft snares using the Crafting skill. A specialist snare kit gives you a +1 item bonus to the check.",
								"{@b Spellbook:} A spellbook holds the written knowledge necessary to learn and prepare various spells, a necessity for wizards (who typically get one for free) and a useful luxury for other spellcasters looking to learn additional spells. Each spellbook can hold up to 100 spells. The Price listed is for a blank spellbook.",
								"{@b Spyglass:} A typical spyglass lets you see eight times farther than normal. A fine spyglass adds a +1 item bonus to Perception checks to notice details at a distance.",
								"{@b Survey Map:} Maps are uncommon.",
								"Most maps you can find are simple and functional. A survey map details a single location in excellent detail. One of these maps gives you a +1 item bonus to Survival checks and any skill checks to Recall Knowledge, provided the checks are related to the location detailed on the map.",
								"Maps sometimes come in atlases, containing a number of maps of the same quality, often on similar topics. An atlas costs five times as much as a single map and requires both hands to use. The GM determines what maps are available in any location.",
								"{@b Tack:} Tack includes all the gear required to outfit a riding animal, including a saddle, bit and bridle, and stirrups if necessary. Especially large or oddly shaped animals might require specialty saddles. These can be more expensive or hard to find, as determined by the GM. The Bulk value given is for tack worn by a creature.",
								"If carried, the Bulk increases to 2.",
								"{@b Ten-Foot Pole:} When wielding this long pole, you can use Seek to search a square up to 10 feet away. The pole is not sturdy enough to use as a weapon.",
								"{@b Thieves’ Tools:} You need thieves’ tools to Pick Locks or Disable Devices (of some types) using the Thievery skill.",
								"Infiltrator thieves’ tools add a +1 item bonus to checks to Pick Locks and Disable Devices. If your thieves’ tools are broken, you can repair them by replacing the lock picks with replacement picks appropriate to your tools; this doesn’t require using the Repair action.",
								"{@b Tool:} This entry is a catchall for basic hand tools that don’t have a specific adventuring purpose. A hoe, shovel, or sledgehammer is a long tool, and a hand drill, ice hook, or trowel is a short tool. A tool can usually be used as an improvised weapon, dealing 1d4 damage for a short tool or 1d6 for a long tool. The GM determines the damage type that’s appropriate or adjusts the damage if needed.",
								"{@b Torch:} A torch sheds bright light in a 20-foot radius (and dim light to the next 20 feet). It can be used as an improvised weapon that deals 1d4 bludgeoning damage plus 1 fire damage.",
								"{@b Vial:} A simple glass vial holds up to 1 ounce of liquid.",
								"{@b Waterskin:} When it’s full, a waterskin has 1 Bulk and contains roughly 1 day’s worth of water for a Small or Medium creature.",
								"{@b Writing Set:} Using a writing set, you can draft correspondence and scribe scrolls. A set includes stationery, including a variety of paper and parchment, as well as ink, a quill or inkpen, sealing wax, and a simple seal. If you’ve written a large amount, you can refill your kit with extra ink and paper."

						"{@i Ten thousand years ago, the world of Golarion came close to ending. Earthfall, as this extinction-level event came to be known, saw the world pummeled by a shower of falling stars that sank continents, hollowed out new seas, and destroyed civilizations. It took centuries for the world to recover, and centuries more for society to rebuild, but recover it did.}"

				"Dwarves ascended to the surface from the underground reaches of the Darklands in their legendary Quest for Sky, elves returned from the neighboring planet of Castrovel via a network of portals to reclaim their lands and traditions, and gnomes from the mysterious First World sought shelter from a now-forgotten terror. Survivors from other ancestries who had sheltered through the terror and destruction of Earthfall emerged during the Age of Darkness to reclaim their ancestral lands, from scrappy goblin tribes with a knack for surviving despite all odds against them to industrious halflings who emerged from the ruins to found societies of their own.",
				"But humanity made the most astounding recovery. Less than 2,000 years after the near-extinction from Earthfall, the Age of Destiny saw the rise of many new human empires throughout the world. Humanity built wondrous structures, and its schools relearned magic that had been thought lost. Among these human nations walked a man named Aroden—an immortal survivor of the devastation of Earthfall. Aroden had long since cultivated a following of loyal subjects who regarded him with awe, for immortality was but one of the wonders he’d achieved. Greatest among these was his discovery of a shard of potent magic known {@i today as the Starstone, a fragment from the stars that fell during} Earthfall, which had lodged at the bottom of the Inner Sea. Contact with this alien artifact assailed Aroden with phantasmagoric visions, subjected him to a series of deadly martial trials, and posed exhausting moral quandaries that challenged his limits more than any of the arduous experiences he had yet endured. He emerged from {@i this test a living god, and his first divine act was to raise the Starstone} and the mass of land on which it had lain from the bottom of the sea to form the Isle of Kortos—also known as Starstone Isle—where he then established the city of Absalom.",
				"In the centuries to follow, Absalom grew into one of the largest cities in the world, and Aroden’s legacy grew alongside it. As the millennia passed, his attentions increasingly turned away from the concerns of the Inner Sea’s inhabitants to otherworldly matters beyond mortal ken, but prophecy spoke of a time when he would return to Golarion and lead humanity triumphantly into an Age of Glory. As the time of Aroden’s return drew near, entire nations undertook monumental preparations to welcome him back to Golarion.",
				"But instead, Aroden died, and with him the reliability of prophecy as well.",
				"Golarion was wracked by storms, war, and supernatural devastation as the god’s death marked the beginning of a new age—a time of uncertainty, but also a time of opportunity. This is the Age of Lost Omens, an age in need of heroes like never before.",

The northern section of Tian Xia connects to Golarion’s northernmost continent, a frozen reach known as the Crown of the World. This continent forms a bridge between Tian Xia and Avistan over the north pole. South of Tian Xia lies the mysterious continent of Sarusan, of which little is known due to the powerful storms and vexing currents that shroud its shores. Heading west from the Inner Sea region, sailors encounter the shattered remnants of lost Azlant, a ruined continent that hosted one of humanity’s first empires until it was destroyed during Earthfall.",

To the vast majority of the planet’s denizens, the other 11 worlds are little more than points of light in the sky, but these worlds are not so distant as one might expect. The planets of Akiton and Castrovel are Golarion’s closest neighbors. Travelers from both have visited and in some cases settled on Golarion, most notably elves, who originally hail from Castrovel.",

The city of Absalom itself, the largest in the Inner Sea region, sprawls on the southern shore of this isle, and at the city’s heart stands the legendary Starstone Cathedral. Within the walls of {@i this structure, the Starstone ever waits to test its next} supplicants—the few mortals who pass this mystic test become gods themselves. This has made Absalom an oft-besieged metropolis, but in its nearly 5,000 years, it has never once fallen.",

From the towering and majestic temples of the Ascendant Court to the close-packed shops and guildhalls of the Petal District and the sagging shanties in the Puddles, Absalom’s neighborhoods never fail to present a memorable skyline. Many world-reaching organizations were born in Absalom, notably the Pathfinder Society (page 436).",

The verdant forests and grasslands of the west provide many of the resources Absalom needs, but to the east, the rugged stony desert known as the Scrape, the dangerous Riven Hills, and the newly formed necromantic wasteland known as the Tyrant’s Grasp present far harsher climates. The Isle of Erran, just north of Starstone Isle, hosts the secondlargest city in the area, Escadar. A rough seaport with more than its share of shady dealings and dangerous types, Escadar also hosts large shipyards and maintains a strong navy that helps to keep the surrounding waters of the Inner Sea safe. A number of smaller islands also skirt the coast of the Isle of Kortos—some barren, some serving as hideouts for criminals and outcasts.",

Not all of the Broken Lands are constantly fraught with peril, but regardless of where one might settle down in these parts’ tumultuous times, danger is rarely far from home.",
						"In some cases, the breaks are political. In the northeast, the nation of Brevoy has hung on the edge of civil war for many years, as the long-running feud between the traditional noble houses of Issia and the mercenary swordlords of Rostland maintain an ongoing state of tension that may be nearing a breaking point. But in the case of the oft-contested River Kingdoms, these political breaks have reached something of a draw, for here it is said that anyone might become the ruler of a nation—if they have the tenacity to seize the reins of rule.",
						"Elsewhere in the {@condition Broken} Lands, the fractures are more spiritual. Razmiran, for example, is ruled by the living god Razmir, who demands the worship of all who dwell within his nation’s borders and brooks no competition of faith. His priests act as police throughout the land, brutally enforcing their deity’s laws. To the north in Mendev, these spiritual breaks are less obvious; this land struggles to reclaim its heritage in the wake of a century of occupation by a crusading force that, until a few years ago, stood as a bulwark against the demons who ruled the lands across the river to the west.",
						"These western lands are truly {@condition broken}, in a physical sense, for in the chaotic times at the dawn of the Age of Lost Omens, powerful agents of the demon lord Deskari tore a hole in reality. The resulting wound in the landscape allowed legions of demons to pour through and devastate the lands once known as Sarkoris.",
						"Although heroes of the Fifth Crusade recently defeated Deskari and closed the rift, these lands are still known as the Worldwound. The main threat has been quelled, but demons still inhabit the region, and the blighted landscape struggles to return to normal.",

However, in the distant past, the crash of a scientifically advanced starship brought strange aliens, mechanical monstrosities, and technological wonders to Golarion, but its fiery arrival left large reaches of the surrounding land blighted and blasted even to this day."

The port-city of Promise on the remote isle of Hermea a few hundred miles west of Avistan rewards well those who can negotiate the privilege of trade, but such honors are hard won, for the dragon who rules this closed society does not allow just anyone to visit. Rumors of what goes on beyond Promise’s dock district range from tales of a perfect society to those of an oppressive government that affords no free will. Farther to the north, the elves of the Mordant Spire are even more closed to visitors, and for most sailors, the only thing the Mordant Spire offers is an unmistakable landmark for navigation, as the twisting spire can be seen for miles.",

						"Millennia ago, the nation of Thassilon was ruled by the sinful, tyrannical runelords. These wizards carved out legends intended to last for an eternity, but even the mighty runelords succumbed to the devastation of Earthfall. The seven reigning runelords of that time retreated into the safety of extradimensional domains, and for eons they slumbered, until they began to wake The frontier realm of Varisia, once the heart of Thassilon, bore the brunt of the wrath of the first wakened runelord, an avaricious sadist named Karzoug.",
						"A band of unlikely heroes emerged from the small coastal town of Sandpoint to eventually face and defeat Karzoug, yet his wakening soon roused other slumbering runelords, and a new band of heroes was forced to defeat the risen tyrants.",
						"While the neighboring Lands of the Linnorm Kings, Realms of the Mammoth Lords, and witch-haunted Irrisen never faced direct repercussions from the runelords, these northern lands hold dangers of their own. A long-running cold war between the vikings of the Linnorm Kingdoms and the winter witches of Irrisen to the east finally came to a sputtering end when a daughter of the immortal witch Baba Yaga attempted to defy her mother and usurp Irrisen’s traditions of rule. While the eternal winter of Irrisen set in place by Baba Yaga endures, its new ruler, Anastasia, may prove to be the first benevolent presence to sit on the throne in centuries. Farther to the east, the Kellid clans of the Realm of the Mammoth Lords played their own pivotal roles in defying the demons of the Worldwound.",
						"Recently, a new nation has risen in the Saga Lands.",
						"After the runelords were defeated, two surviving runelords decided to adjust their traditions to fit this strange new world they found themselves in. Now the fledgling nation of New Thassilon sprawls along the northern border of Varisia, and it remains to be seen if its rulers will fully adopt a more peaceful path, or if it is but a matter of time before the old traditions of sin and violence rise once again."

						"Northeast of Druma lie the forested elven lands of Kyonin, one of Avistan’s oldest nations. This land belonged to the elves long before Earthfall, but for thousands of years after that devastation, they left their realm abandoned. In that time, a powerful demon named Treerazer seized control of the forest’s southern reaches, corrupting the terrain into a swampy, desolate mire called Tanglebriar. Although the elves have returned, they’ve been unable to force Treerazer from their southern border.",

Its people are tired and desperate as they continue to live what lives they can in the shadow of the souls of those they decapitate. If any of the regions of the Shining Kingdoms is poised for significant change in the near future, it is surely revolution-wracked Galt."

The Shackles are ruled by a council of pirate lords who call themselves the Free Captains; they sail the southern Arcadian Ocean and follow their own code of rules when it comes to who can be raided and what can be sunk—even if, to their victims, those rules seem capricious and arbitrary."

Each mode provides a different pace and presents a different level of risk to your characters. The Game Master (GM) determines which mode works best for the story and controls the transition between them.",
				"You’ll likely talk about the modes less formally during your play session, simply transitioning between exploration and encounters during the adventure, before heading to a settlement to achieve something during downtime.",
				"The most intricate of the modes is {@b encounter mode} . This is where most of the intense action takes place, and it’s most often used for combat or other high-stakes situations. The GM typically switches to encounter mode by calling on the players to “roll for initiative” to determine the order in which all the actors take their turns during the encounter.",
				"Time is then divided into a series of rounds, each lasting roughly 6 seconds in the game world. Each round, player characters, other creatures, and sometimes even hazards or events take their turn in initiative order. At the start of a participant’s turn, they gain the use of a number of actions (typically 3 in the case of PCs and other creatures) as well as a special action called a reaction. These actions, and what you do with them, are how you affect the world within an encounter. The full rules for playing in encounter mode start on page 468.",
				"In {@b exploration mode} , time is more flexible and the play more free form. In this mode, minutes, hours, or even days in the game world pass quickly in the real world, as the characters travel cross country, explore uninhabited sections of a dungeon, or roleplay during a social gathering. Often, developments during exploration lead to encounters, and the GM will switch to that mode of play until the encounter ends, before returning to exploration mode. The rules for exploration start on page 479.",
				"The third mode is {@b downtime} . During downtime, the characters are at little risk, and the passage of time is measured in days or longer. This is when you might forge a magic sword, research a new spell, or prepare for your next adventure. The rules for downtime are on page 481.",

Every game is different, because you’ll rarely, if ever, make the same decisions as another group of players.",

If you’re traveling along a forest path and come across a fork in the trail, the GM will ask, “Which way do you go?” You might choose to take the right fork or the left. You could also choose to leave the trail, or just go back to town. Once your choice is made, the GM tells you what happens next. Down the line, that choice may impact what you encounter later in the game, but in many cases nothing dangerous happens immediately.",

								"Specific Overrides General A core principle of Pathfinder is that specific rules override general ones. If two rules conflict, the more specific one takes precedence. If there’s still ambiguity, the GM determines which rule to use. For example, the rules state that when attacking a concealed creature, you must attempt a DC 5 flat check to determine if you hit. Flat checks don’t benefit from modifiers, bonuses, or penalties, but an ability that’s specifically designed to overcome concealment might override and alter this. If a rule doesn’t specify otherwise, default to the general rules presented in this chapter. While some special rules may also state the normal rules to provide context, you should always default to the normal rules even if effects don’t specifically say to.",
								"Rounding You may need to calculate a fraction of a value, like halving damage. Always round down unless otherwise specified.",
								"For example, if a spell deals 7 damage and a creature takes half damage from it, that creature takes 3 damage.",
								"Multiplying When more than one effect would multiply the same number, don’t multiply more than once. Instead, combine all the multipliers into a single multiplier, with each multiple after the first adding 1 less than its value. For instance, if one ability doubled the duration of one of your spells and another one doubled the duration of the same spell, you would triple the duration, not quadruple it.",
								"Duplicate Effects When you’re affected by the same thing multiple times, only one instance applies, using the higher level of the effects, or the newer effect if the two are the same level. For example, {@i if you were using mage armor and then cast it again, you’d} still benefit from only one casting of that spell. Casting a spell again on the same target might get you a better duration or effect if it were cast at a higher level the second time, but otherwise doing so gives you no advantage.",
								"Ambiguous Rules Sometimes a rule could be interpreted multiple ways. If one version is too good to be true, it probably is. If a rule seems to have wording with problematic repercussions or doesn’t work as intended, work with your group to find a good solution, rather than just playing with the rule as printed."

						"{@b Circumstance bonuses} typically involve the situation you find yourself in when attempting a check. For instance, using Raise a Shield with a buckler grants you a +1 circumstance bonus to AC. Being behind cover grants you a +2 circumstance bonus to AC. If you are both behind cover and Raising a Shield, you gain only the +2 circumstance bonus for cover, since they’re the same type and the bonus from cover is higher.",
						"{@b Item bonuses} are granted by some item that you are wearing or using, either mundane or magical. For example, armor gives you an item bonus to AC, while expanded alchemist’s tools grant you an item bonus to Crafting checks when making alchemical items.",
						"{@b Status bonuses} typically come from spells, other magical effects, or something applying a helpful, often temporary, condition to you. For instance, the 3rd-level {@i heroism spell grants a +1 status bonus to attack rolls,} Perception checks, saving throws, and skill checks. If {@i you were under the effect of heroism and someone cast the bless spell, which also grants a +1 status bonus on} attacks, your attack rolls would gain only a +1 status bonus, since both spells grant a +1 status bonus to those rolls, and you only take the highest status bonus.",
						"Penalties work very much like bonuses. You can have {@b circumstance penalties} , {@b status penalties} , and sometimes even {@b item penalties.} Like bonuses of the same type, you take only the worst all of various penalties of a given type. However, you can apply both a bonus and a penalty of the same type on a single roll. For example, if you had {@i a +1 status bonus from a heroism spell but a –2 status} penalty from the sickened condition, you’d apply them {@i both to your roll—so heroism still helps even though} you’re feeling unwell.",
						"Unlike bonuses, penalties can also be {@b untyped} , in which case they won’t be classified as “circumstance,” “item,” or “status.” Unlike other penalties, you always add all your untyped penalties together rather than simply taking the worst one. For instance, when you use attack actions, you incur a multiple attack penalty on each attack you make on your turn after the first attack, and when you attack a target that’s beyond your weapon’s normal range increment, you incur a range penalty on the attack.",
						"Because these are both untyped penalties, if you make multiple attacks at a faraway target, you’d apply both the multiple attack penalty and the range penalty to your roll.",

If you roll a 1 on the d20 (a “natural 1”), your result is one degree worse. This means that a natural 20 usually results in a critical success and natural 1 usually results in a critical failure. However, if you were going up against a very high DC, you might get only a success with a natural 20, or even a failure if 20 plus your total modifier is 10 or more below the DC. Likewise, if your modifier for a statistic is so high that adding it to a 1 from your d20 roll exceeds the DC by 10 or more, you can succeed even if you roll a natural 1! If a feat, magic item, spell, or other effect does not list a critical success or critical failure, treat is as an ordinary success or failure instead.",

This subordinate action still has its normal traits and effects, but is modified in any ways listed in the larger action. For example, an activity that tells you to Stride up to half your Speed alters the normal distance you can move in a Stride. The Stride would still have the move trait, would still trigger reactions that occur based on movement, and so on.

								"This rule’s purpose is to make the game run smoothly, with one guiding hand ensuring consistency. It’s not intended to make one player into a dictator over the rest of the group. Collaboration is vital to roleplaying games!",
								"How you implement collaboration in a game depends on what your players are interested in. In some groups, players enjoy adding details to the world and to nonplayer characters. In others, players want to feel like the world is outside their control, and the only decisions they get to make are those made by their own characters. Both are fun and acceptable ways to play.",
								"You are encouraged to collect input from your players before you start, asking what storytelling genres they’d like to emphasize, which areas of the world they want to play in, the types of enemies they’d like to face, or which published adventure they want to play. A good campaign includes some back-and-forth at the beginning as the players figure out what characters they want to play and you figure out what sort of adventure to run. The results can range from building an adventure entirely to fit the characters to choosing a specific published adventure, having the players make their characters, and then just adapting the beginning of that adventure so that all the player characters have a reason to be involved.",
								"As you play, opportunities to collaborate will occur again and again. When players throw out suggestions or come up with specific theories about the events of the campaign, they’re telling you what they’d like to see in the game. Try to find ways to incorporate their suggestions, but with enough of a twist that each still includes something unexpected."

						"A single session, or a “one-shot,” is great if your group is trying out Pathfinder or wants to play a specific short adventure. This requires a smaller time commitment but requires the GM to present the events of the game in a way that is immediately engaging, since there’s less opportunity for the players to become invested in the story or setting.",
						"If you want to play through a longer campaign, you’ll need to add some story elements that speak directly to the characters in your game rather than just to the events of the adventure. In other words, the characters should have individual goals in addition to the group’s overall goals.",
						"You can estimate how long a campaign will take by looking at the amount of time you actually have to play, or the number of character levels you intend the characters to advance. It typically takes three to four sessions for a group to level up. Since you’ll probably cancel sessions on occasion, playing once a week for a year results in roughly a 14-level campaign, playing every 2 weeks for a year gives you an 8-level campaign, and playing monthly allows for a 5-level campaign. If you play only once a month, you might consider holding longer sessions and using fast advancement (page 509).",
						"It’s entirely okay to have a campaign with an indefinite length. Many groups play through one adventure and then decide to take on another. If you run an indefinite campaign, however, avoid ongoing plots that you can’t satisfactorily end if the campaign comes to a close after the next adventure. If you introduce an overwhelmingly powerful villain who’s crucial to the story but can’t be stopped until the player characters are 15th level, ending the campaign at 8th level will feel anticlimactic.",
						"It pays to be conservative when estimating your campaign length and scope. It’s always tempting to run a 20-level epic campaign with complex, interwoven plots, but such games can fall apart long before the end if your group can play only once a month and the players have other responsibilities.",
						"Not every campaign ends at the same point. Some campaigns go all the way to 20th level, ending after the player characters attain the height of power and confront the greatest threats any mortal could face. Others end at a lower level, after the group takes down a major villain or solves a crucial problem. And still other campaigns end when players become unable to attend or decide its a good time to stop playing.",

You can, however, ask for clarification if you need it, such as “How far back should I rewind this?” Some groups instead make an X with their hands, say “Let’s X that out,” or use some other method.

								"During a session, you’re in charge of keeping the game’s action moving, managing the different modes of play, fielding questions, and making rules decisions. You’ll also want to keep a rough eye on the time, so you can end when most convenient for the group.",
								"You’re the interface between the rules and the imagined world you and the other players share. They will ask you questions, and they’ll act based on their own assumptions. It’s up to you to establish what’s true in the world, but you don’t do this unilaterally. You’re informed by the setting’s backstory, your preparations, and the suggestions and assumptions the other players bring to the table. Keep in mind that until you announce something, your own plans are subject to change. For example, if you originally intended the owner of a tavern to be kindly and well-intentioned, but a player misreads her and invents an interesting conspiracy theory regarding her intentions that sounds fun, you might convert the tavern owner into an agent of evil after all.",
								"You’ll also determine when PCs and foes need to attempt checks, as well as the consequences of those rolls. This comes up most often outside of encounters, as encounters are more regimented about when checks happen and how they are resolved. In an encounter, a player can usually determine their own character’s turn, with you chiming in only to say whether an attack hits or if something in the environment requires a character to attempt a check.",
								"As you run the game, keep track of who has the spotlight.",
								"It can be easy to keep attention on the most outgoing player or character, but you need to check in with all the players. If a player hasn’t contributed in some time, stop and ask, “What’s your character doing at this point?” If the player’s not sure, add a detail or nonplayer character to the scene that the player might find interesting.",
								"Maintaining the players’ attention keeps a game moving and leads to memorable moments when everyone’s in the same zone. Too many interruptions break the flow. This is fine in moderation. Distractions become a problem if they’re too frequent, as they cause people to miss things and make misinformed decisions as the session becomes disconnected. Yet every game includes breaks—sometimes intentional, sometimes not—and digressions. Finding the right balance of diversions for your group is essential.",
								"A game is a social gathering, so there’s definitely a place for conversation that’s not directly related to playing the game. These interruptions become a problem if they’re too frequent, or if people are talking over others. If a player repeatedly interrupts you or other people or undercuts every crucial moment of the game with a joke, talk to them about limiting their comments to appropriate times. Often, all you need to do is hold up your hand or otherwise indicate that the player is talking out of turn to delay them until after you or another speaker finishes talking.",
								"Phones and other mobile devices are another major source of distraction. Banning them entirely is often impractical—many players use apps to roll dice or manage their character sheets, or they need to answer texts from their partner, check in on a work project, or otherwise stay connected with people who rely on them. However, you can set ground rules against using a device for anything that’s not time-sensitive or game-related, such as refreshing social media, checking the score of a hockey game, playing a mobile game, or answering a non-urgent text. You can relax these rules for players when their characters are “offstage.” If a player’s character isn’t in a scene, that might be a good time for the player to use a mobile device."

For example, ability scores can’t normally be retrained, as that can unbalance the game.

For example, even the best 1st-level PC has grim odds against an incredibly hard 1st-level DC, with a huge chance of critical failure, but by 20th level, an optimized character with a modicum of magic or assistance can take down incredibly hard 20thlevel DCs over half the time, critically failing only on a 1.

If a character in your group had Aberration Lore, you might determine that it would be easy or very easy to use that skill and adjust the DC to 17 or 14.

For instance, hags are humanoids but have a strong connection to occult spells and live outside society, so you might allow a character to use Occultism to identify them without any DC adjustment, while Society is harder.

One Lore subcategory won’t cover an entire country or all of history, but it could cover a city, an ancient civilization, or one aspect of a modern country, like Taldan History Lore.

If an effect deals initial damage in addition to {@condition Persistent Damage|CRB|persistent damage}, apply immunities, resistances, and weaknesses separately to the initial damage and to the {@condition Persistent Damage|CRB|persistent damage}.

Before the end of that creature’s next turn, a trap poisons you, making you {@condition enfeebled} 2 for 1 minute.

								"Redundant Conditions with Values Conditions with different values are considered different conditions. If you’re affected by a condition with a value multiple times, you apply only the highest value, although you might have to track both durations if one has a lower value but lasts longer. For example, if you had a {@condition slowed} 2 condition that lasts 1 round and a {@condition slowed} 1 condition that lasts for 6 rounds, you’d be {@condition slowed} 2 for the first round, and then you’d change to {@condition slowed} 1 for the remaining 5 rounds of the second effect’s duration.
